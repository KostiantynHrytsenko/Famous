<p>Wardell Stephen Curry II (born March 14, 1988), also known as Steph
Curry, is an American professional basketball player for the Golden
State Warriors of the National Basketball Association (NBA), where he
plays as a point guard. Nicknamed “Chef Curry”, he is widely regarded as
the greatest shooter in basketball history and is credited with
revolutionizing the game by popularizing the three-point shot across all
levels of basketball.</p>
<p>He is a four-time NBA champion, a two-time NBA Most Valuable Player
(MVP), an NBA Finals MVP, and a two-time NBA All-Star Game MVP. He is
also a two-time NBA scoring champion, an eleven-time NBA All-Star, and
an eleven-time All-NBA Team selection (including four on the First
Team). Internationally, he has won two gold medals at the FIBA World Cup
and a gold medal at the 2024 Summer Olympics as part of the U.S.
national team.</p>
<p>Curry played collegiately for the Davidson Wildcats, where he was
named Conference Player of the Year twice. He set the NCAA single-season
record for three-pointers made (162) as a sophomore and led the NCAA
Division I in scoring during his junior year. Curry was selected by the
Warriors as the seventh overall pick in the 2009 NBA draft.</p>

<ol type="1">
<li><strong>Freshman season</strong><br />
Before Curry even played in his first game for the Wildcats, head coach
Bob McKillop praised him at a Davidson alumni event, saying: “Wait ’til
you see Steph Curry. He is something special.” In his second collegiate
game, he recorded a season-high 32 points and nine rebounds against
Michigan. He had 30 points and a season-high 11 rebounds against
Chattanooga on December 18, 2006, for his first career double-double. On
February 6, 2007, also against Chattanooga, Curry broke the school’s
500-point freshman record. He went on to finish with 730 points. He also
broke Davidson’s single-season record for three-pointers held by Brendan
Winters (2004–05). He led the Southern Conference in scoring at 21.5
points per game, ranking him ninth nationally and second nationally
among freshman behind only Kevin Durant of Texas.</li>
<li>In his <strong>sophomore season</strong><br />
in 2007–08, Curry helped the Wildcats to a 26–6 regular-season record, a
20–0 conference record, and a trip to the 2008 <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2007_NCAA_Division_I_men%27s_basketball_tournament">NCAA</a>
tournament. On March 21, 2008, Davidson matched up with seventh-seeded
Gonzaga. Gonzaga led by 11 points early in the second half but Curry
went on to score 30 points in the half to push Davidson to their first
NCAA tournament win since 1969 with a score of 82–76. Curry ended the
game with 40 points while also going 8-of-10 from three-point range. On
March 23, Davidson played second-seeded Georgetown in the second round,
with Curry scoring just five points in the first half of the game as
Davidson trailed by as many as 17 points. His 25 second-half points led
Davidson to a 74–70 comeback victory. On March 28, Curry led Davidson to
another win, against third-seeded Wisconsin. He scored 33 points as
Davidson won 73–56 to advance to the Elite 8. Curry joined Clyde
Lovellette, Jerry Chambers, and Glenn Robinson as the only college
players to score over 30 points in their first four career NCAA
tournament games. Curry also tied Darrin Fitzgerald of Butler for the
single-season record for most three-pointers with 158. On March 30, he
set the record, against the top-seeded Kansas Jayhawks, with his 159th
three-pointer of the season. Curry scored 25 points in the game but
Davidson lost 59–57, and the Jayhawks went on to win the
championship.</li>
<li><strong>Golden State Warriors (2009–present)</strong><br />
On June 25, 2009, his father’s 45th birthday, Curry was selected as the
seventh overall pick in the 2009 NBA draft by the <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_State_Warriors">Golden State
Warriors</a>. The day of the draft, Curry’s father Dell, who wished for
his son to be drafted with the eighth pick by the New York Knicks,
called teams with higher picks and urged them not to draft his son. The
Minnesota Timberwolves agreed not to draft Curry, and subsequently
drafted two other point guards with the fifth and sixth picks. Warriors
head coach Don Nelson chose to disregard Dell’s wishes and drafted him
anyway, one pick before the Knicks would have the opportunity
to.Although the Warriors already had another lean, 6-foot-3,
offensive-minded guard in Monta Ellis, Nelson had a penchant for using
small lineups in his Nellie Ball system, and had warmed to the idea of
selecting Curry. However, Ellis announced at a media session that he and
Curry were too small to play together. Curry appeared in 80 games (77
starts) during the 2009–10 season, averaging 17.5 points, 4.5 rebounds,
5.9 assists, and 1.90 steals in 36.2 minutes. His second half of the
season vaulted him into the rookie of the year race. He was named
Western Conference Rookie of the Month for January, March, and April,
finishing as the only Western Conference rookie to win the award three
times. He finished runner-up for the NBA Rookie of the Year behind
Tyreke Evans and was a unanimous NBA All-Rookie First Team selection,
becoming the first Warriors player since Jason Richardson in 2001–02 to
earn All-Rookie First Team honors. He scored 30-plus points eight times,
setting the most 30-point games by any rookie in 2009–10 and the most
since LeBron James had 13 and Carmelo Anthony had 10 in 2003–04. Curry
had five 30-point/10-assist games, which tied Michael Jordan for the
second-most 30-point/10-assist games by a rookie (Oscar Robertson is
first with 25). He became just the sixth rookie in NBA history to post a
35-point, 10-assist, 10-rebound game when he registered his first career
triple-double with 36 points, 13 assists, and 10 rebounds against the
Los Angeles Clippers on February 10. In the Warriors’ season finale
against the Portland Trail Blazers on April 14, Curry recorded a then-
career-high 42 points, nine rebounds and eight assists, becoming the
first rookie since Robertson in February 1961 to register at least those
numbers in each category in the same game. Curry finished his rookie
season with 166 three-pointers, which were, at the time, the most ever
by a rookie in NBA history.</li>
